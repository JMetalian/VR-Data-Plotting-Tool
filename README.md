# VR-Data Plotting Tool

This project is created as a tool that will be used in Unreal Engine-based projects. It allows to visualize the data that is provided from project side as CSV, Data Map or Data Table. The main objective is to demonstrate the percentages of the data fields. The data can be provided already in percentages or could be raw fields that require prior percentage calculation.
